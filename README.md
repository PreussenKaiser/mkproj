# mkproj

Script I use for scaffolding projects, it does the following:
- Creates a new directory and initializes it as a Git repository.
- Renames the 'master' branch to 'main'.
- Adds a .gitignore and README.md file.
- Makes a /src and /tests directory.

### Running
#### Windows
Edit the $PATH environment variable by pointing it to the script's location.
